This is a program of moprhological analysis (Russian, German, and English languages).

This program is distributed under the Library GNU Public Licence, which is in the file
COPYING.  

This program was  written by Andrey Putrin, Alexey Sokirko.  
The project started in Moscow in Dialing 
Company (Russian and English language). The German part was created  
at Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in  Berlin (the project DWDS). 

The Russian  lexicon is based upon Zaliznyak's Dictionary .
The German lexicon is based upon Morphy system (http://www-psycho.uni-paderborn.de/lezius/).
The English  lexicon is based upon Wordnet.

The project uses a regular expression library "PCRE" (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions).
We test compilation only with version 6.4. Other versions were not tested. 
One should download this version  from the official site and install it 
to the default place. If you do not want to install it or you do not have enough
rights to do it, then you should  create two environment variables: 
	1.  RML_PCRE_LIB, that  points to PCRE library directory, where
libpcre.a and libpcrecpp.a should be located, for example:
	export RML_PCRE_LIB=~/RML/contrib/pcre-6.4/.libs
    2  RML_PCRE_INCLUDE, that points to PCRE include catalog, 
where "pcrecpp.h" is located, for example
    export RML_PCRE_INCLUDE=~/RML/contrib/pcre-6.4


The system has been developed under Windows 2000 (MS VS 6.0), but
has also been compiled and run under Linux(GCC).  It should work with
minor changes on other systems.

I compiled all sources with gcc 3.2. Lower versions are not supported.

=================================================
====== 					 Installation       =====
=================================================


Unpacking

* Create  a catalog and  register a system variable RML, which  points 
to this catalog:
	mkdir /home/sokirko/RML
	export  RML=/home/sokirko/RML

* Put "lemmatizer.tar.gz", "???-src-morph.tar.gz"
to this catalog, "???" can be "rus", "ger" or "eng"
according to what you have downloaded. Unpack it 
 	tar xfz lemmatizer.tar.gz
	tar xfz ???-src-morph.tar.gz



Compiling morphology

  0. Do not forget to set  RML_PCRE (see above)


  1.  cd $RML
	

  2.   ./compile_morph.sh  
      This step should create all libraries and a test program $RML\Bin\TestLem.


Building Morphological Dictionary

  1.  cd $RML

  2.   ./generate_morph_bin.sh <lang>
     where <lang> can be Russian, German according to the dictionary
    yo have  downloaded.

  The script should terminate with message "Everything is OK". 
  You can test the morphology 
	$RML\Bin\TestLem <lang>





If something goes wrong, write me to sokirko@yandex.ru.

==========      MRD-file                  ============
======================================================

	This section describes the format of a mrd-file. Mrd-file is a text 
file which contains one morphological dictionary for one natural language. 
MRD is an abbreviation of "morphological dictionary".
	The usual place for this file is 

	$RML/Dicts/SrcMorph/xxxSrc/morphs.mrd,

where  xxx can be "Eng", "Rus" or  "Ger" depending on the language. 
    The encoding of the file depends also upon the language:
	* Russian - Windows 1251
	* German  - Windows 1252
	* English - ASCII


   Gramtab-files


	A mrd-file refers to a gramtab-file, which is 
language-dependent and which contains all possible full morphological 
patterns for the words. One line in a gramtab-file looks like as follows:
	<ancode> <unused_number> <part_of_speech> <grammems>
	An ancode is an ID, which consists of two letters and which uniquely  
identifies a morphological pattern. A morphological pattern consists of 
<part_of_speech> and <grammems>. For example, here is a line from the English
gramtab:

	te 1 VBE prsa,pl      

	Here "te" is an ancode,  "VBE" is a part of speech, "prsa,pl" are grammems,
"1" is the obsolete  unused number.
    In mrd-files we use ancodes to refer to a  morphological pattern.

	Here is the list of all gramtab-files:
	* Russian - $Rml/Dicts/Morph/rgramtab.tab
	* German  - $Rml/Dicts/Morph/ggramtab.tab
	* English - $Rml/Dicts/Morph/egramtab.tab



   Common information 


	All words in a mrd-file are written in uppercase.
	One mrd-file consists of the following sections:
		1. Section of flexion and prefix models;
		2. Section of accentual models; 
		3. Section of user sessions;
	    4. Section of prefix sets;
		5. Section of lemmas.
	Each section is a set of records, one per line. The number of all records 
of the section  is written in the very beginning of the section at 
a separate line. For example, here is a possible variant 
of the section of user sessions:

1
alex;17:10, 13 October 2003;17:12, 13 October 2003

"1" means that this section contains only one record, which is written  
on the next line, thus this section contains only two lines.



	Section of possible flexion and prefix models


	Each record of this section is a list of items. Each item 
describes how one word form in a paradigm should be built. The whole list
describes the whole paradigm (a set of word forms with morphological patterns). 
The format  of one item is the following:
		%<flexion>*<ancode>
	or  %<flexion>*<ancode>*<prefix>
		where  
			<flexion> is a  flexion (a string, which should be added to right of the word base)
			<prefix> is a  prefix (a string, which should be added to left of the word base)
			<ancode> is an ancode.
	Let us consider an example of an English flexion and prefix model:
		%F*na%VES*nb
	Here we have two items:
		1. <flexion> = F;   <ancode> = na
		2. <flexion> = VES;   <ancode> = nb
		In order to decipher ancodes we should go the English gramtab-file. 
There we can find the following lines:
			na NOUN narr,sg        
			nb NOUN narr,pl
		If base "lea" would be ascribed to this model,  then its paradigm 
would be the following:
		leaf 	NOUN narr,sg
		leaves	NOUN narr,pl
	It is important, that each word of a morphological dictionary 
should contain a reference  to a line in this section.


	Section of possible accentual models


	Each record of this section is a comma-delimited list of numbers, where 
each number is an index of a stressed  vowel of a word form(counting 
from the end). The whole list contains a position for each word 
form in the paradigm.	
	If an item of an accentual model of word is equal to 255, then it 
is undefined, and it means that this word  form is unstressed.  
	Each word in the dictionary should have a reference  to 
an accentual model, even though this model can consist only of empty items.
	For one word, the number and the order of items in the  accentual model 
should be equal to the number and the order of items  in the flexion and 
prefix model. For example we can ascribe to word "leaf" with the paradigm  
		leaf 	NOUN narr,sg
		leaves	NOUN narr,pl
the following accentual model:

	2,3

	It produces the following accented paradigm: 
		le'af 	NOUN narr,sg
		le'aves	NOUN narr,pl

		

	Section of user section

	This is a system section, which contains information about user edit 
sessions.


	Section of prefix sets

	Each record of this section is a comma-delimited list of strings, where 
each string is a prefix, which can be prefixed to the whole word. If a prefix 
set is ascribed to a word, it means, that the words with these prefixes
can also exist  in the language. For example, if "leaf" has 
the prefix  set "anti,contra", it follows the existence of  words "antileaf",
"contraleaf".
	A flexion and prefix model can contain
also a reference to a prefix, but this prefix is for 
one separate word form, while a prefix set  is ascribed to the whole word 
paradigm.

	
	Section of lemmas

	A record of this section is a space-separated tuple of the following format:

	<base> <flex_model_no> <accent_model_no> <session_no> <type_ancode> <prefix_set_no>

	where 

	<base> is a base (a constant part of a word in its paradigm)
	<flex_model_no> is an index  of a flexion and prefix model
	<accent_model_no> is an index of an accentual model
	<session_no> is an index of the session,  by which the last user edited this word
	<type_ancode> is ancode, which is ascribed to the whole word 
						(intended: the common part of grammems in the paradigm)
					   "-" if it is undefined 
	<prefix_set_no> is an index of a prefix set, or "-" if it is undefined
